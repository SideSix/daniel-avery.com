            <h2>A Brief History</h2>
          </header><!-- /header -->
          <p>I was born one of those cold October days in Minnesota when the leaves are aflame. My mother, June, and father, Len, had found my name written on a tree three months earlier...actually, my father's name was the initial "B" and his middle name was Leonard. (This is probably going to get pretty long at this rate...jumping ahead a few years.)</p>
		  <p>Realizing that my career as a filling station attendant was going to be replaced by a little slot for credit cards, I enrolled at the University of Minnesota. One of the only classes left open was "American Literature: Poetry and Prose." I hated poetry. I had no idea what prose was, but I was pretty sure I'd hate that also. Then one day we read "A Dream Deferred" by Langston Hughes. I had been in Harlem a couple of months prior to reading the poem. For the first time in my life I "got" a poem; I not only understood it, I began to see how one might write such a thing.</p>
		  
		  <p>(<strong>Editor's Note:</strong> At this point in the document, Mr. Avery became particularly long-winded and I've edited out about 35 pages.)</p>
		  
		  <p>And so that is how I eneded up at Macalester College, in Saint Paul. Take my advice and find a way to attend a small, private liberal arts college. The education you receive is far superior to that at a state university. At least it was at Macalester. I majored in English, minored in Religious Studies, founded a writers group and edited the literary magazine. When I graduated I worked at the United Way of the Saint Paul Area for a couple of years and then landed at the University of California, Irvine in the M.F.A. Fiction Writing program.</p>
		  
		  <p>(<strong>Editor's Note:</strong> Jesus this guy can get going if he catches some wind in his sails. That particular tanget lasted a good 85 pages. While it was fairly humorous, who wants to read something that long on a damn computer screen?)</p>
		  
		  <p>So having taught writing for 18 years I finally burned out and left academia.  I still miss the chalk dust.</p>
