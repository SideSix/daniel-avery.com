  <h2>Thank You!</h2>

<p>Your form has been submitted and it's on the way to Dan right now. Changes are good he already has it, unless the internet is "down" or is being heavily censored by the United States Government.</p>

<p>Dan will be getting back to you within 24 hours. Unless he has reached an untimely demise.</p>

<p>Best Wishes,</p>

<p>Miss Havisham</p>
