            <h2>Hi, my name is Dan. I create stuff.</h2>
          </header><!-- /header -->
              <p>One day back in the 1970's, I realized that I liked creating stuff. It's a fascinating process, creation, and I've spent a lot of my adult life engaged in and thinking about the process.</p>             
              <p> Of course when you start talking about what really happens in the creative process you immediately sound "crazy as a loon" to those listening, unless your Michelangelo. </p>
              <aside class="clearfix:after">
                {% blockquote Michelangelo, Famous Artist %}
                  I just chiseled away the marble that wasn't David.
                {% endblockquote %}
              </aside>
              <p>I guess if you are actually Michelangelo, the women come and go talking about you. (Sorry. That's an old English major's joke.)</p>
            <p>Here's a list of some stuff I create that might interest you:</p>

          <h3>Contact Me</h3>
          
          <p>I know most sites use a contact form, but those damn things are so impersonal. I think a letter is much nice to receive than disjointed pieces of information.  If you would like to contact me just <script type="text/javascript">document.write(
"<n uers=\"znvygb:qna\100qnavry-nirel\056pbz\">qebc zr n yvar<\057n>".replace(/[a-zA-Z]/g, function(c){return String.fromCharCode((c<="Z"?90:122)>=(c=c.charCodeAt(0)+13)?c:c-26);}));
</script> and let me know what's up.</p>
