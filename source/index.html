              <p>One day back in the 1970's, I realized that I liked creating stuff. It's a fascinating process, creation, and I've spent a lot of my adult life engaged in and thinking about the process.</p>             
              <p> Of course when you start talking about what really happens in the creative process you immediately sound "crazy as a loon" to those listening, unless your Michelangelo. </p>
              <aside class="clearfix:after">
                {% blockquote Michelangelo, Famous Artist %}
                  I just chiseled away the marble that wasn't David.
                {% endblockquote %}
              </aside>
              <p>I guess if you are actually Michelangelo, the women come and go talking about you. (Sorry. That's an old English major's joke.)</p>
