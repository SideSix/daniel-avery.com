Larry Gilbert is running around town with what little hair he has left on fire.  He's frantic because he can't get anyone to endorse Cathy Schlicht. As Gomer Pyle used to say, "Surprise...surprise...surprise..." Most people in Mission Viejo are wise to Schlicht's, well, Shlicht.  If you know what I mean...nudge...nudge...say no more...say no more.

Lately Old Lar has been telling people "you know we're following Frank Ury and Wendy Bucknum." He means that literally.  **Larry's group actually stalks people.** And now they're stalking other city council candidates like they stalked Mission Viejo's former city manager.  That stalking caper didn't end well for the taxpayers.  A legal judgement was awarded to the former city manger that was hefty enough to build a dog park. We're talking $600,000 plus.  There is no telling how this current stalking adventure will end. But my money is on the city taking it in the shorts again.

The reason old Lar thinks stalking is fun, I mean besides the fact that he's an idiot, is that he's mean and twisted, and he's never had to pay the consequences.  This is the man, who defended Art Pedroza's redirecting internet traffic to the **North American Man Boy Love Assocication**.  If you're unclear as to what the North American Man Boy Love Association actually is, I'll help you out here. That particular organization exists solely to help grown men sexually abuse very young boys. Eight year old boys. This isn't the Indian Guides folks.  Larry **clearly** has no problem with redirecting internet traffic to them.  The courts did, however. Most people who have morals would. 

Larry Gilbert is Cathy Schlicht's official campaign manager. He's calling everyone begging for an endorsement. Cathy doesn't call them herself, which is odd, but I guesss she's "busy," or something. Larry is getting more and more angry each time someone says "no." He's amped up Schlicht's failing campaing to "stalking." How far away is "violence?" 

I get why Cathy Schlicht would pick Larry for a campaign manager.  The $64,000 question is why did the Mission Viejo Chamber of Commerce decide these two would be good ambassadors for the organization?  The business owners who are members of the Mission Viejo Chamber of Commerce should start asking the Board some **serious** questions.
