Each day the New York Times has a quote of the day.  Today's is below:

{% blockquote New York Times http://newyorktimes.com %}
QUOTATION OF THE DAY

"This man will not fail. This man will not let us down. This man will lift up America."<br>
ANN ROMNEY, speaking about her husband in an address at the Republican National Convention.
{% endblockquote %}

So when, exactly, did a trite cliché become quotable?  Are we really that marginally literate as a nation that we would listen to that and think anything other than "Bullfuckingshit?" 

**These are truly the last days for America.**
