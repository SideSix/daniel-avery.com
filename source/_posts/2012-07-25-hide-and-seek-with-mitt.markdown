If you liked Dick Chaney, you are going to love Mitt "I got a Koch Problem" Romney. Old Mitt makes Dick look like a giddy sorority girl spilling it over her latest crush. Mitt promised to be completely transparent when he ran the Olympics, but revoked that pledge and went to defcon six. Mitt quit his Olympic job ala Sarah Palin in order to run for governor of Massachusetts; his buddy from Bain, Fraser Bullock, took over and destroyed any records from Mitt's tenure.

Romeny did four years as Massachusetts Governor and in the last year spent $100,000 for new computers. This was on the eve of his 2008 Presidential bid. Eleven Romney aides bought their hard drives from the state, and his staff had his emails and other electonic communications wiped from the Massachusetts' State Servers before he left office. 

He hides his Mormonism, he hides his past by destroying records, and he's hiding his tax returns because there is something there he acknowledges would hurt him.

This guy is a serious candidate for the office of President of the United States because?
