Holy Fucking Jesus...

How the hell did I just miss the Month of March here?

Okay here's the deal...And you'll get this if you live anywhere but Southern California.  

I moved back to Minnesota for about a year when my Dad was dying and my friend, Pete, who is a great guy and **very** observant said, "Hey man, all your stories about California, they are all happening in Summer. Didn't anything happen at other times of the year?"

Well shit, I thought about this. And I thought: "well I was wearing socks during some of that shit..."

So I told Pete: "Listen man, anytime I got socks on? It's fucking winter."
