Even for Mission Viejo politics, Desi Kiss is extremely corrupt and stupid. He is clearly complicit in three separate cases of copyright infringement committed by Douglas Bowen. They stole the work of three different writers in order to build a website. These geniuses don't have the cognitive skills to string together enough words to make a cogent sentence. So they steal in order to look like a creditable site. You can [find the site here](http://applebomb.com), but **be warned** that the **site places a tracking cookie on your computer**.

In addition Kiss has added his photos to other authors' posts on Patch.com. When I busted him for it, he ignored it. When Lazlo pushed it, he gave the reply below.

{% blockquote Desi Kiss %}
"In any event, if they were uploaded inadvertently such images/photos were deleted immediately." 
{% endblockquote %}

That statement is stunningly stupid. Unless you were shit-faced drunk, I mean rock bottom of a vodka bottle, it would be impossible to inadvertently add photos to someone's post. There are several steps to add one photo; Kiss added three photos in all to one of my posts and countless others all over Patch. Secondly they were not deleted immediately. The ones on my posts were deleted by me a week later when I discovered them. 

So that one sentence means one of four things:

1.  Kiss is a vindictive drunk.
2.  Kiss is stupid.
3.  Kiss is an extremely lousy liar.
4.  Kiss thinks we're dumber than him.

In our next class on Mission Viejo, we will deconstruct Kiss' bullying tone in the quote above, and then we'll use what we learn to make an argument for number 1 in the last above.
