Well...yes...indeed...the idiots are drooling at the gate again. In any election campaign there are certain signs that your opposition has crossed beyond "desperate" and the below is a perfect example. It reminds me of those kids in High School that couldn't handle being "**not** cool."  

Don't get me wrong.  I wasn't cool in high school by any stretch of the imagination.  I have vague memories of knowing how to splice a movie in the back of a classroom and get it up there on the wall again. 

But I mean, really, 40 years later we have people not only putting up questionable homemade signs to try to, in an exccedingly pathetic way, discredit their opponent. Don't they realize what they are SCREAMING to the commumity. These people are 50, 60, and 70 years old.  Now that is truly scary.
