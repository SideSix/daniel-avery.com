Well...yes...indeed Morton's Morons were out in full-force tonight at the city council meeting to rail, not about the all too real and completely immature signs, but about the completely imaginary signs that are not planned for Mission Viejo.  And while it's always fun to watch these folks drool as they ramble and rave, there is a very real issue confronting Mission Viejo voters:

**Candidates Ed Sachs and Cathy Schlicht have violated campaign laws.**
 <a target="blank" href="http://missionviejo.patch.com/blog_posts/fppc-to-investigate-two-mission-viejo-city-council-candidates">Read an article about that here</a>.  
 
 And I'm not talking about some obscure law no one understands; I'm talking about the basic and insanely easy to implement laws regarding the identification of the person(s) or organization that paid for the mailing and/or campaign literature.  Name, address, campaign id number and that's it.  Insanely easy.

So then why aren't the Schlicht or the Sachs campaign obeying the laws? Well, that's an interesting question to ask.  How bad can the organization, PAC, Union, or person be that is funding their mailings and literature? The answer is **not very bad at all.** This is Mission Viejo folks. Not the sort of place that corrupt money wants to buy multiple seats on the city council.  

**So why hide who is paying for the mailings and literature? Probably because neither candidate has respect for the law.** 

And I'm being serious as -40 degrees Fahrenheit. Both are members of the Tea Party and Sachs attends ACT for America meetings. At least according to the Calendar he put on his campaign site he attends them.  He's also made stunning anti-muslim comments on his Facebook page.  Both have pledged to the Saddleback Republican Assembly that they would do as much as they humanly can do get rid of city services in Mission Viejo and reduce the already small city government. You know, services like the Library and the animal shelter; services which remind of our humanity and teach us thing about that humanity all at the same time.  Schlicht and Sachs have both struck me as those folks who just have no time for humanity. 

I mean sure, humanity can get pretty complicated awfully darn fast.  But do you really want people who can't get past that to have anything to do with your government; I mean besides emptying the trash once all the decision makers have gone home. 

We all know what people who don't "believe in Government" are called, and just how violent the world they want is in actuality.  

With Rhonda Reardon's help, Schlicht's few friends were able to parade in front of the council with well, a parade, of lies about an issue that isn't even before the council. The issue was resolved at the beginning of June by a 5 to 0 vote. Every claim that the issue will come back is pure conjecture. The nicest thing that anyone can say about the people spreading the lies of huge electronic billboards proliferating the city is that they are mindlessly repeating a lie they heard and never checked out.  The kindest you can be to these people is claiming that they are stunningly moronic. 

They are cowards who are screaming "transparency" while hiding who is paying for their campaigns.
