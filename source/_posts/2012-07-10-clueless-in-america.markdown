  A money manager in a green Jeep said it was time for Romney to "up his game and be more reactive." So far, said the donor (who would not give his name because he said it would hurt his business), Romney has had a "very timid offense."

  A New York City donor a few cars back, who also would not give her name, said Romney needed to do a better job connecting. "I don't think the common person is getting it," she said from the passenger seat of a Range Rover stamped with East Hampton beach permits. "Nobody understands why Obama is hurting them.

  "We've got the message," she added. "But my college kid, the baby sitters, the nails ladies -- everybody who's got the right to vote -- they don't understand what's going on. I just think if you're lower income -- one, you're not as educated, two, they don't understand how it works, they don't understand how the systems work, they don't understand the impact."

The real reason "nobody" understands why Obama is hurting them is because he isn't hurting anyone, especially the rich who ride in Range Rovers stamped with East Hampton beach permits. It's that cut and dried.

People **are** hurting because a Republican administration ruined the economy by fighting two wars after cutting taxes. People are hurting because a Republican Administration and a Republican controled Congress looked the other way while their Wall Street Masters crashed the global economy.  People are hurting because a Republican Administration and a Republican Congress bailed out the banks without making them accountable for what happened to billions and billions of tax dollars. 

The clueless in America are saying that Obama is hurting this country for **two simple** reasons. 

1. A Republican Administration and a Republican Controlled Congress fucked up so badly a Black Man was elected President.

2. They don't dare say that because they know **exactly** how it will sound.

I say elect Mitt and he'll fuck up so badly we'll be able to elect a Black Woman President the next time 'round. I stand with the "nail ladies", the "baby sitters," and that condesending bitch's "college kid."
