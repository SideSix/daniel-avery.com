When my older brother Mike was young he had a friend named "Franky Welcome." Old Franky was invisible, but a good friend who went everywhere with my brother Mike until one day our dad decided that Mike was too old to be running around talking to and associating with invisible people. Here's how it went down: they got in the car one day and my dad started pulling out of the parking lot. Mike was alarmed because Franky Welcome was still back in the National T grocery store.  My dad didn't stop.  He just left Franky Welcome to wander the aisles of the National T Grocery Store alone, invisible, and friendless.

I know that sounds cold, but, unlike Brad Morton, my brother grew up to become a nationally recognized attorney, a president of the National Lawyers Guild, a champion of Civil Rights, an expert in Constitutional law and an expert in police misconduct. Brad Morton went to law school; now he runs a blog where his and other peoples' invisible friends routinely are the "residents" commenting on the supposed "issues" affecting Mission Viejo.

So when it comes to Mission Viejo Council Members Cathy Schlicht and Rhonda Reardon, Larry Gilbert, Francis Holtzman, Allan Pilger, and Brad Morton, they and their invisible friends often holler into the winds of stupidity on Morton's blog.  Take for example an entry at the Mission Viejo Dispatch by someone named "G.H. Godrey."

I agree with Larry, Flojo Park is a great place to let our pooches run. Nobody but dogs seem to use that wide expanse and everybody cleans up after their pets! It’s never crowded, people, pets and kids get along so well in that area, whether walking, running or playing! There is no additional cost here to the great tax payers of Mission Viejo…But maybe if more people knew about this lovely park less would be said about spending money that (I guess we need) should go to cutting down leaning trees, fixing the broken sidewalks and trying to get more businesses to put down stakes in our fair city!

There isn't one single registered voter in all of Orange County named G.H. Godrey, or anything close.  Not one. In fact, if you Google G.H. Godrey, all of the hits resolve to the Mission Viejo Dispatch.  It would seem that the Dispatch is the only place this person exists. Do you really know any actual flesh and blood people who don't get a serious and real Google hit in 2012?  

Well, enough of rhetorical questions.  This pattern happens time and time again at the Dispatch. People who comment and are not registered voters anywhere in Orange County, people who if you search for them on Google only exist at the Mission Viejo Dispatch. 

So how many issues have Schlicht and Reardon used these invisible friends to support their positions?  I'm thinking all of them.  Maybe I'll drive back down to the National T store and consult with Franky Welcome.  I bet he'd know.  They must network or something. These invisible friends.
