It's official. The United States has officially scared me now. A reality show about war co-staring Todd Palin called "Stars Earn Stripes?" Really? We're reducing war to entertainment for a bunch of red-necked morons in the south? And they will eat it up. Trust me.  They'll laugh their iggnorant asses off at d-listed stars and how they "handle" guns. And at some point, Donald Trump will be one of the "stars." Count on it.

I hope to hell the rest of the world is as frightened by this new NBC show as I. I hope to hell they are in earnest talks to invade us. The rest of the world would **never** dream of "entertainment" entailing handing Kathy Griffin and Gary Busey AK47s and sending them crashing into the woods while Todd Palin screams at them like some sort of deranged drill Sargent, or, you know, like his wife. That's not *just* disprectful, folks, it's actually malignant. 

The reality of war, the one that NBC won't show us, the reality that we've been ignoring for over a decade now, is that the United States has killed elderly men and women, we've killed moms, and we've killed children. The Defense Department calls this "collateral damage." The Defense Department won't tell us how many grandmoms, moms, and kids we've killed over the last decade, but other countries estimate it in the six figures. Let's just say the population of Minneapolis or Portland. 

Our tastes are seriously fucked up if we think that war is a fit subject for a "reality" show staring anyone, let alone Nanookie of the North's husband.
