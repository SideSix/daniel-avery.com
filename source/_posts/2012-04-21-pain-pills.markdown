I've been having problems on my lower east side lately...so Victoria sent me to the Dentist.  Silly woman. I mean what did she think it was gonna cost?  

"Sweet Jane..."

<!-- more -->

I have always felt at home on the island of Manhattan because of all the bridgework. It's not a replica of my mouth, but it's close. Dentists have always smiled when I enter their offices. Sort of that "Hey there, come on in" smile.

"And I feel just like Jesus's son and I guess I just don't know...I guess I just don't know..."

When your dentist can quote Bob Dylan, or even Lou Reed, or Eric Clapton...well that means you're going to get some pretty good drugs, but it will be expensive as all hell.  

So just how expensive is Hell these days?  You really don't want to know.  Not even if you were "born a thousand years ago..."

All I'm doing here is waiting for the Vicodin to take effect.

Oh and I'm listening to Lou Reed...The "Rock and Roll Animal" album.  I still listen to albums by the way. I don't know about you.

"And I guess I just don't know...and I guess I just don't know"

It really doesn't matter what political persuasion you are.  It really doesn't. Either you are totally hip or you aren't.  Paul Bucknum is hip. Todd Bagley is a piece of shit.  That's life, that's what people say...you're "riding high in April and you're seriously shot down in May."

You get fifty bonus points if you can tell me who said the last part of the sentence above in quotes. Unless, of course, you live in Minneapolis and then that quote is hard-wired into you. Or if you are Lazlo or Father Frank because that just wouldn't be fair....I got questions for Lazlo and Father Frank but this is, clearly, not the place.
