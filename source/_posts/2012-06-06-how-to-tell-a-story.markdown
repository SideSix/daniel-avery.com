Forget Love and War...   
find Ernest Hemingway   
write about white elephants   
memorize the way crows argue   

high in eucalyptus trees   
swaying leaves frantic "caw caw"   
the smell of burnt tobacco and popcorn   
in the distance a radio announcer   

a leather ball cracks against hickory wood   
the soft growl of lawn mower   
there are always colors, red, orange, yellow   
cold beer, cold bottle of beer here   

peanuts...popcorn...peanuts...popcorn   
now batting for the Minnesota Twins   
number three Harmon Killebrew   
stories start in the middle of the middle   

the first thing Bonnie told Wilson   
about 11:30 a.m. at the Circus Circus bar   
was that she kept a loaded    
.357 magnum under her pillow   

stories need people like Carl   
his blue tweed cap, the Krazy Kat button   
just above the bill over his left eye   
selling newspapers, scarf around his neck   

cars jabberwocky on the lawn   
a couple strolls among them      
a white railing, the paint worn   
meaning born within details   

chipped the railing must be chipped   
furniture gouges sudden, deep   
we moved in two decades ago  
two missing panes of blue glass   

the sun rises red, orange, yellow   
over the trees and the Johnson's home   
across the street, kids grew up   
sounds changed slowly as wheels grew
