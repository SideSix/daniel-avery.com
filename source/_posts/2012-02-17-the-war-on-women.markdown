This week **The Right** declared open warfare on women and I've pulled some of the more choice salvos from articles. We'll start out with Rick Santorum's Sugar Daddy:

{% blockquote Foster Friess http://thinkprogress.org/health/2012/02/16/427233/foster-friess-contraception/ Santorum Sugar Daddy Foster Friess Gives ‘Gals’ Contraception Advice: Put An Aspirin Between Your Knees %}
 “You know, back in my days, they used Bayer Aspirin for contraceptives. The gals put it between their knees and it wasn’t that costly.”
 {% endblockquote %} 
 
 <!-- more -->
Meanwhile over at the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Chairman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) block the testimony of a female law student from Georgetown University because he didn't believe the woman was <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/lawmakers-debate-mandated-coverage-of-contraceptives-in-health-care-law/2012/02/16/gIQAgf3jIR_story.html?sub=AR">**"appropriate and qualified"**</a> to discuss the cost of birth control. The implication of this one alone left me wondering why The Republicans expect one single vote from a woman.

{% img right /images/liz-trotta.png 176 163 'Fox News' Liz Trotta Hates Women Apparently' 'An image of Fox New's Liz Trotta' %}Not to be outdone by this level of rancid hate, Fox News' Liz Trotta went completely off the rails to prove just how butch she is to her *Fox* cohorts:

{% blockquote Liz Trotta http://thinkprogress.org/security/2012/02/13/424239/fox-women-miliary-expect-raped/ Fox Pundit Says Women In The Military Should ‘Expect’ To Be Raped %}
I think they have actually discovered there is a difference between men and women. And the sexual abuse report says that there has been, since 2006, a 64% increase in violent sexual assaults. Now, what did they expect? These people are in close contact, the whole airing of this issue has never been done by Congress, it’s strictly been a question of pressure from the feminist.

And the feminists have also directed them, really, to spend a lot of money. They have sexual counselors all over the place, victims’ advocates, sexual response coordinators. … So, you have this whole bureaucracy upon bureaucracy being built up with all kinds of levels of people to support women in the military who are now being raped too much.
{% endblockquote %}

And then on CNN Rick Santorum gave his opinion on women in combat by cashing in on the "Women are emotional" argument and phrasing it in "classic weenie speak."

{% blockquote Rick Santorum, CNN %}
 “People naturally may do things that may not be in the interests of the mission because of other types of emotions that are involved.”
{% endblockquote %}

All of this and, sadly, much **much** more in one week's time while in the past few months there has been a net 18% swing away from Mitt Romney in favor of President Obama among unmarried women in the past few months. Note that it's unmarried women. Somehow the Republican party attracted them and now it's hell-bent on repulsing them. Or is it?

Wars have always been fought for a non-stated reason. It's **never** to protect democracy at home and if you believe that's why we fight them, then you are a for real idiot and may God look kindly upon you. **The Right's** callous disrespect for every female on the planet, including their own wives and daughters, is nothing new, but this week it became as brazen as a two-dollar whore giving blow jobs in New Orleans Square at Disneyland. Why? 

### Mitt's Finance Co-Chair Runs a Ponzi-Scheme

Well one possibility is to take the heat off a story that surfaced, but didn't get the traction it would have if **The Right** wasn't publically flogging the image of women. That story was about Mitt Romney's Sugar Daddy who has been pulling a snake-bully routine to theaten and silence critics. 

Mitt's National Finance Co-Chair Frank VanderSloot owns Melaleuca, Inc. Melaleuca peddles dietary supplements and cleaning products. Quite the combo. *Forbes,* back in 2004 declared Melaleuca to be a "pyramid selling organziation, built along the lines of Herbalife and Amway." In other words a Ponzi-scheme.

Frank VanderSloot is a devout Mormon who in the last few weeks has threated litigation against *Forbes* and *Mother Jones* in order to get articles that were critical of him removed. He's spent years in Idaho doing the same thing against journalists and bloggers, even going so far as to sue local bloggers for "copyright infringment" because they published a threatening letter sent by VanderSloot's lawyers. 

**In other words, he's a soulless bully with billions of dollars and a few highly paid attorneys. Think about it. Then consider just how badly Mitt will harm democracy with a pitbull like that.**
