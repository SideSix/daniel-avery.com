We live in interesting times. That's an old Chinese curse, the living in interesting times; these days part of the curse entails devaluing just about any thing which with we come into contact. Worse of all we devalue our language, at least here in the United States, and sure as you're sitting there reading this, that will mean a return to barbarism. 

In the last week or so, I've gotten a couple of "friend" requests. It's a sign of our modern times.  The word "friend" is an abstraction. It has as many meanings as there are people walking the planet; thus, like all abstractions, it's a fairly meaningless word in even the best of times. Back when people used English with precision, if ever a time did exist, the word "friend" was usually tied to some concrete image.  It was an image that embodied other abstractions like "loyalty," "honor," "faithfulness," "second self," and so on, but we pictured a specific person who would have our back no matter what the outcome. Someone we could absolutely count on to do the right thing, to be honest with us no matter the cost, and to have our best interests at heart. We pictured someone it was an honor to spend our time with; someone we were proud to know simply because of who they were. Someone for whom we would do anything. Someone exactly like Norm Oppegard or John Maginnis.

God only knows what the word "friend" actually means today. But judging from the frequency of "friend" requests these days, and the way "friendships" are formed on reality television, the word is entirely bereft of meaning. So it is a with a great deal of trepidation that I approach these requests when I encounter them in my email queue.  I mean, one never knows who will be in there these days.  Does one?

This week I found Orange County Deputy Joe Dixon. I met Deputy Dixon because he married the daughter of good friends. What I know of him is that he's a stand up guy in the best sense of the word; he possesses a quiet strength born of confidence backed by wisdom. He talks straight and means what he says because he truly respects the other people in his life; Deputy Dixon is completely honest and loyal. It would be a rare privilege and honor to be his friend. Joe's request was sincere, so I approved it quickly.  I felt flattered that he would reach out to grow our friendly acquaintance. I look forward to that a great deal.

I also found a request from [Art Pedroza](http://www.readwriteweb.com/enterprise/2011/12/blogger-v-blogger-socal-cybers.php). Art Pedroza is best known because he promoted gay porn and sex between men and underage boys on web domains he owned. He did so by cloaking links on the Orange Juice Blog and other domains, while he owned them; the links led people to gay porn sites and to the North American Man Boy Love Association web site. 

The North American Man Boy Love Association (NAMBLA) is exactly as bad as it sounds; it's an organization that encourages men to have sexual relationships with pre-teen boys.  Pedroza veiled the link to NAMBLA by suggesting it led to an Orange County Public Relations Firm, and then he emailed the firm's owner and demanded money to take the link down. Picking a fight with public relations professionals is a stunningly stupid move; they made Pedroza's link-cloaking **very** public. Pedroza quickly rerouted the link to wikipedia. When the bad press started Pedroza claimed it was only a "prank," and his Juice Brothers used "Art didn't start it" as a defense.

I have no clue what possessed Pedroza to want to "friend" me. The thought makes my flesh positively crawl.  I can only assume his request has something to do with the upcoming election.  After all, Pedroza's good friend Larry Gilbert is already running around Mission Viejo, as Cathy Schlicht's campaign manager, threatening people and trotting out his shop-worn, dirty tricks.  Some people were clearly meant to be friends.  You know?
