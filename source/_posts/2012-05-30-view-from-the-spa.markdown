 The view from the spa had been constricted by the decaying pergola. Having been built 30 years earlier out of redwood, the pergola caught whatever fell from the pines, the sycamores, and the eucalyptus.  Picture the last few chapters of *The Great Gatsby* when the fa√ßade of opulence had worn thin and decay had contentedly set down roots. That's what the view from the spa was like...Gatsby after the parties

When you sat in the hot churning water, under the pergola, you felt the weight of what the middle class in America has become. You felt the cracks, the areas softened by termites, One morning a woodpecker had worked hanging upside down until there was lumber floating in the spa and the woodpecker had a home for her nest. 

America's middle class has become decidedly cheap and littered with grand notions. What's left, reeks of Desperation's sweat and it probably doesn't have the sense to turn off the lights and lock up. There's the smell of fear because something is slipping away ever so slowly, like the days of Autumn as they pass into Winter's ice.

It's our fall:  **The Descent**, passed off as a "relaxing soak in your own backyard." And under the pergola it felt close and hot and it smelled of money gone bad in the pockets of Billionaires. And, so, in **true** American style we sawed up the decay and hid it in huge dumpsters that were hauled away by big, green trucks. 

And now when I lie in the hot tub and look up, my head underwater to mute the suburban sounds, I see nothing but leaves and light.  In the late afternoons, the sun makes pine needles shine like brand new pennies.
