Okay so I bet the title made my brother Mike's heart stop for a few seconds.  His daughter's name is Kate.  Actually, it's Katherine, which I've always thought was a beautiful name, but for some reason I've always called my niece "Katie."

That paragraph was idle thought that wasn't going to work out as one of those tangents I like to use to wade into a piece of writing. So let's start again, shall we?

Oh my God, the Queen must be swearing like a late 17th Century sailor who decided to become an entrepreneur in the Caribbean. You see the Duchess of York was seen in pubic removing the top of her already indecent swimming attire. This is in public, mind you, in full view as it were and not in some forgotten garden alley at Balmoral, where only God really knows what goes on. Royal Nipplige in public is frowned upon. Definitely "We are not amused"land. I mean the bare breasted, full-on royal nipples with no hand-bra is just, oh, I don't know, "tacky" I think best describes the behavior, once your sleeping in a fucking palace every damn night.  Next she'll be tokin' on blunts and snorting lines right in front of us, topless.  The big old "fuck you" to the commoners. Yeah, I'm Royal, un huh, un huh... 

The Queen has a point, you know. Maybe you actually have to get older, maybe partly senile, I am not sure, but I think she has a point. I mean, someone should have a sense of decorum, a sense of propriety. And why not the Windsor? Their family has been in the Decorum and Propriety business for centuries. "If you want your next cocktail party to not just go well, but to be positively civilized, call the House of Windsor"... The entire thing falls apart if the Duchess of York acts like a topless, party girl.  All of a sudden customers are upset..."Put the Queen on...Yeah, I'll wait...damn right I'll wait...royal moth...errr...is that you, Your Majesty? Un-huh, yeah, well, listen here...you need to reign that girl in..." 

I went to Google and, well, Googled "Topless Kate," go ahead you junior high and high school readers, Google away...I'll wait...I was curious and, okay, let's get honest, men {% img left /images/kate-topless.jpg 'The Duchess Of York' 'A photo of Kate Middleton topless' %}never really do grow all the way up, right?  I've noticed that no matter how hard I try and how much I learn...I'm still a cretin...a pig...I'm ashamed of myself. I've often wondered if it's that contraction and the last three words in that sentence they just don't buy. No sale. Yeah, right, okay...

Anyway, I am the curious type. I caught a partial headline. I had to find out for myself. Turns out Kate Middleton has tabloid nipples. Like on a cartoon.  The whatchmacallit....halftone approach to nipples. It also turns out that as you scroll down the Google page, there are a lot of women named Kate who have also bared their top half to the world. Or in the case of Kate Upton, almost bared the entire top half. Kate Upton would appear to be the Queen of the hand-bra. And she is clearly a woman who should be court-ordered to appear completely sans hand-bra in public at all times. 

There are probably six guys in the world who are straight and can honestly say, "Oh no, Baby, I don't think that way." Probably not a surprise to any woman who has been following Republican politics this year. "Legitimate rape?" Please. That is just giving the rest of us a **really** bad name. 

And there are your political choices for this year.  You can vote for the guys who want to see Kate Upton completely nude. Screw that topless shit, dude. Or you can vote for the guys who want to see Kate Upton completely nude and talk to you about "legitimate rape".

Some fucking choice right?
